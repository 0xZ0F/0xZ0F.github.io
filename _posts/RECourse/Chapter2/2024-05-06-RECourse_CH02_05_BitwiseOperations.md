There are a few binary operations that you should know about. They are used for all sorts of things as you will see throughout the course.

These operations include **NOT**, **AND**, **OR**, and **XOR**.

### NOT

**NOT** simply flips a bit. In other words, it changes the bit to what it's not.  
* NOT 1 = 0
* NOT 0 = 1

### AND

**AND** checks if both bits are 1 and if they are the result is 1, if not the result is 0.
* 1 AND 1 = 1
* 1 AND 0 = 0
* 0 AND 0 = 0

### OR

**OR** checks if either of the bits is one, if so then the result is one.
* 1 OR 1 = 1
* 1 OR 0 = 1
* 0 OR 0 = 0

### XOR

**XOR** checks if either of the bits is one, **but not both**, if so then the result is one.
* 1 XOR 1 = 0
* 1 XOR 0 = 1
* 0 XOR 0 = 0

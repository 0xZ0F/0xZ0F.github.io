## Important Notes:

This course will continue to be maintained and expanded whenever I feel up to it. I will never be anywhere close to finished as I will likely always have new ideas. If you have any feedback or suggestions let me know on Twitter!

I use some technical lingo and abbreviations. If you forget what they mean, or don't know what they mean, check out the [lingo page]({%link {{site.course_links.re.lingo}}%}).
